        <p>One of the biggest misconceptions about cloud? That it somehow makes IT infrastructure less important.
          Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, infrastructure has never been more critical to the success
          of the business.
          That’s because technology itself has never played a greater role than it does today—helping companies deliver
          profitable growth, create innovative experiences and operate in a responsible, sustainable way.
          <br>
          <br>
          Infrastructure is the backbone of the modern “ever-ready” digital enterprise. As discussed in our research on
          the Cloud Continuum, cloud is no longer just a single, static destination, but an operating model for
          innovation across a continuum of capabilities and technologies—everything from public cloud to smart devices,
          digital factories and connected vehicles.
          <br><br>
          Infrastructure is the foundation that allows companies to seamlessly operate this vast extension of
          capability. It provides the compute, network, workplace and database platform capabilities needed to run the
          applications that run the business. It also provides the foundation on which exceptional customer and employee
          experiences can be built.

        <h2>New Infrastructure, new challenges</h2>
        <p>
          However, as the technology continues to evolve and accelerate—and the demands placed on it continue to grow—IT
          departments are under ever-more-intense pressure. Traditional approaches are increasingly limiting their
          ability to adapt, innovate and compete.
          What’s changed? As Marc Andreessen famously said, software is eating the world. And this is particularly true
          in infrastructure engineering. The shift to infrastructure-as-code is creating huge new opportunities for
          rapid and agile innovation.
          <br><br>
          At the same time, enterprises are recognizing that “cloud” does not simply mean public cloud. The evolution of
          the Cloud Continuum requires organizations to dynamically balance public, private, hybrid, co-location,
          multi-cloud, and edge to support the ever-changing needs of the business.
          <br><br>
          Plus, consider the distributed nature of today’s workspaces and workloads. In the past, an enterprise
          typically had a limited number of sites and a finite number of connections to worry about. Now—and especially
          because of the pandemic—connectivity is required anywhere and everywhere.
          For a large global organization, this can mean hundreds of thousands of new locations that need continuous
          connectivity to the cloud, which dramatically increases the need for modern enterprise networks. These
          networks must meet a wide and rapidly changing set of business requirements and provide seamless, secure
          connectivity to data, applications and platforms.

        <h2>A renaissance in infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
          It’s clear that IT infrastructure has become a much more complex environment to orchestrate. If you don’t
          rethink the way you architect in that environment, you risk ending up with a “spaghetti soup” of
          complexity—which can have serious real-world consequences.
          <br<<br>
            In the worst cases, IT performance can actually deteriorate in the cloud. Despite the world-leading
            infrastructure, the high-quality assets, and the more democratized innovation you get from the cloud
            providers,
            an enterprise can still struggle to match the level of performance the organization achieved in its
            on-premises
            data center. Why? Because the infrastructure and processes, and the skills supporting them, aren’t able to
            keep
            pace with new digital business requirements.
            This need to rearchitect for the cloud is why we say there’s a renaissance in infrastructure. And a renewed
            recognition of its criticality to the modern enterprise.
            <br>
            <br>
            This renaissance is also evident in the availability, sophistication and scalability infrastructure can now
            deliver. In fact, this is now the single biggest differentiator for a digital business. Winning companies
            architect their infrastructure for competitive advantage across this wide and expanding array of capability.
            This is one of the key reasons the digital natives have had such huge and disruptive success. Modern IT
            infrastructure enables enterprises to do new things, create new products, develop new offerings, enter new
            markets, and conduct new experiments at a pace that was previously unthinkable.

        <h2>What are email newsletters?</h2>
        <p>
          Email newsletters are a type of email that is sent to your subscribers containing curated informational
          content such as the latest blogs, product updates, resources, tips, news articles, stories, and many more. In
          short, there’s no end to what you can include in your newsletters.
          <br><br>
          The goal is to share relevant and valuable information with your subscribers, keep them engaged, and foster
          meaningful relationships. Plus, these help build brand authority and help you better communicate with
          customers at every stage of their buying journey.
          <br><br>
          You can send your newsletters weekly or monthly depending on what you want to share and the frequency in which
          your customers expect them.
          <br><br>
        <h2>Why are email newsletters important? </h2>
        <p>
          Now let’s discuss why you need to send out email newsletters to your customers.ces.
          <br><br>
            1.More coverage: An average person checks their email 15 times per day or every 37 minutes. Further, business
            emails make up the majority (126 billion) of emails sent daily. Hence, newsletters can provide ecommerce
            brands enormous opportunities to get their content, products, and services in front of a massive audience in
            a short period.<br><br>
            2.Increased credibility: A newsletter is an excellent opportunity to highlight your expertise in a specific
            field. When you consistently provide valuable, relevant, and personalized content to your subscribers, you
            boost their trust in your brand. Plus, they rely on your brand as a source of knowledge, products, and
            services.<br><br>
            3.Personalization: Reaching the right audience increases the chances that customers will open and read your
            newsletter content. Email marketers can consider their customers’ behavior and preferences to create
            personalized newsletters and deliver content, products, or services that subscribers are more likely to
            consume. In short, email newsletters can help you meet the needs and expectations of different audience
            segments.<br><br>
            4.Strong relationships: Usually, an email newsletter is not perceived as a marketing tactic but an excellent
            channel for communicating and delivering value to your customers. If you understand who your customers are,
            know their needs and struggles, and provide valuable, relevant information to them that solves their
            problems, you’re more likely to not only build but strengthen relationships with them.<br><br>
            5.High returns: Your subscribers have already shown some interest in your products or services. They are more
            responsive to your marketing efforts than those you might find via social media or paid channels. This makes
            newsletters the most effective type of email for engaging your customers. Add to this the relatively low
            cost of email marketing, and you get a high return on investment of more than $36 for every dollar spent.
